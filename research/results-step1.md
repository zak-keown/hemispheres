# Step 1 results: synthetic-world toy

*2026-09-23. All runs on an M5 Max (MLX 0.32.2, fp32). Each run's records are in [`results/step1/runs/`](../results/step1/runs/). [`results/step1/REPORT.md`](../results/step1/REPORT.md) regenerates every table below from them, with question counts, 95% intervals, source files and the code version of each run.*

## Setup

- **Worlds.** Typed knowledge graphs with 10k people, 800 companies, 60 universities, 200 cities and 25 countries, and 13 relations (~62.6k facts). Worlds A, B and C share every token but no entity names (`hemispheres/synth`). The multi-world pool adds 15 more worlds from name partitions 3–7, disjoint from B and C.
- **Questions.** 1–3-hop, e.g. "the capital of the country of the birthplace of X". Scored by exact match on the generated answer, never token-by-token scoring. The `test_ood` split asks about people who appear in no multi-hop training question.
- **Models.** GPT, "small" size (8 layers, d=512): 25.5M parameters. The latent arm adds 3 read layers and a key encoder, for 29.2M (+14%). Every run: 10k steps, batch 64 × 256 tokens, AdamW 1e-3 with cosine decay.

| Arm | Where facts live | How it answers |
|---|---|---|
| dense | weights | directly |
| lookup | store; the model writes `[LOOKUP] subject @rel [RESULT]` and the store inserts the value | one written lookup per hop, then the answer |
| context | prompt (gold facts + 6 distractors) | directly (**in-context oracle; currently broken, see below**) |
| latent | store, read **inside the forward pass**: 3 read layers retrieve by learned query · key and cross-attend over retrieved name tokens | directly, with no lookup tokens |

Latent variants, changing one thing at a time:

- `latent-a`: world A only; retrieval supervised only before a name starts.
- `latent-a-all`: supervision at every name token (`--supervise all`).
- `latent-multi`: as `latent-a-all`, trained across 16 worlds, each step drawing its batch and store from one world.

All latent runs use hop supervision: an InfoNCE loss on each read layer's query, weight 0.5.

## Main results

Question counts per cell: world A 200 per hop count; 100 edited facts (500 for 1,000 edits); ripple and locality 500 each; worlds B and C 900. The world-A cells and `dense + FT on edits` were first logged during training without per-question records. They were rerun from the saved checkpoints on 2026-09-25, and all 74 logged cells came out identical.

| | lookup | dense | dense + FT on edits | latent-a | latent-a-all | **latent-multi** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| World A, 1 hop, held-out people | 100 | 100 | — | 100 | 100 | **100** |
| World A, 2 / 3 hop, held-out people | 100 / 100 | 5.5 / 7.5 | — | 100 / 99 | 100 / 100 | **100 / 100** |
| 100 edits: edited fact | 100 | 0 | 100 | 98 | 100 | **100** |
| 100 edits: ripple (multi-hop through an edit) | 100 | 2.2 | 14.6 | 99.4 | 100 | **100** |
| 100 edits: locality (untouched questions) | 100 | 33 | 9.2 | 99.8 | 100 | **100** |
| 1,000 edits: ripple | 100 | 2.0 | — | 99.8 | 100 | **100** |
| World B swap (unseen), all hops | 99.6 | 1.1 | — | 42 | 86 | **100** |
| World C swap (unseen), all hops | 99.7 | — | — | 39 | 88 | **100** |

- "dense + FT on edits": `dense-a` fine-tuned for 200 steps on the 100 edited facts. It learns them (100%), but they barely propagate (14.6%), and it destroys unrelated knowledge: untouched 1-hop accuracy falls to 25%. This is the pattern MEMIT, fine-tuning and MQuAKE show for real models.
- "dense → world B": 2,000 steps of continued training on world B's bios gave 0% on world B. That's a weak baseline (bios only, short), not strong evidence.
- In every latent run, retrieval accuracy at the answer position is 100% at every hop on every world by the end of training. In the early `latent-a` smoke run it was far lower.

## The latent arm's world-swap failure and its fix

In `latent-a`, retrieval on world B was already 100% at every hop. Answers failed on multi-token names:

| World B accuracy by answer type | latent-a | latent-a-all | latent-multi |
|---|---|---|---|
| people | 0 | 99 | 100 |
| companies | 36 | 100 | 100 |
| universities | 4 | 77 | 100 |
| cities | 11 | 69 | 100 |
| countries | 4 | 66 | 100 |
| currencies | 78 | 78 | 100 |
| single-token values (years, majors, industries) | 100 | 100 | 100 |

The currency misses are all the shilling and the ducat, which no world-A country uses. A model trained on world A alone never writes them, and `lookup-a` misses the same 4 of 18 even though its lookup returns the right value.

The model copied the first name token from the retrieved fact and completed the name from world-A spelling patterns, e.g. gold "Boru Krestizor", output "Boru Vizi". Two changes fixed it:

1. **Supervising retrieval at every name token** took world B from 42 to 86%. The remaining errors were name endings, e.g. "Bragorus" became "Bragoru" and "Bizir College" became "Bizir Institute".
2. **Multi-world training** removed the remaining errors: 100% on worlds B and C.

## Leakage: do the reasoners hold facts themselves?

These use world-A questions. `--store none` hides every store value, and `--store data/world-c` serves world C's facts instead.

| | own store | values hidden | world C's store |
|---|---|---|---|
| lookup-a | 100 | 0 | 0 |
| latent-a | 99–100 | 2–7 | 0–2 |
| latent-a-all | 100 | 1–5 | 1–2 |
| latent-multi | 100 | 1–2 | 1–2 |

Every store-based model falls to chance without its store, including `latent-a`, which saw only world A. So `latent-a`'s world-swap failure was not memorized *facts*: it had learned how world-A names are *spelled*, not which fact belongs to whom. This is the first evidence in this project that the reasoner can be close to knowledge-free, at least for this entity-level knowledge.

## Hop supervision is necessary

`latent-multi-nohop` repeats `latent-multi` with `--hop-weight 0`: nothing tells a read layer which fact to fetch, so retrieval can only be learned from the next-token loss. It was stopped at step 3,300 of 10,000 because nothing had emerged.

| | latent-multi (hop weight 0.5) | latent-multi-nohop (hop weight 0) |
|---|---|---|
| Retrieval top-1, hops 1 / 2 / 3, step 500 | 97 / 45 / 1.5 | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Retrieval top-1, hops 1 / 2 / 3, step 3,000 | 99.8 / 98.7 / 98.6 | 0.001 / 0.01 / 0.16 |
| Training loss, step 3,000 | 0.51 | 1.13 (flat since step ~2,000) |
| World A held-out people at step 2,000: 1 / 2 / 3 hop | 94.5 / 86 / 90.5 | 8 / 6 / 4 |

Retrieval stays at chance (1 in 62.6k is 0.0016%). The model ignores the store and does worse than `dense-a`, because world A is only a sixteenth of its training data, so it can't memorize it either. The unused InfoNCE loss, logged but not trained on, rose from 11 to a peak of 113 at step 1,700 (79 at step 3,000): queries and keys grow without lining up.

The likely cause is the hard top-k. Each read keeps 4 of 62.6k entries, and the retrieval score gets gradient only through the entries it keeps. At initialization the right fact almost never makes the top 4, so its score is never pushed up. This is the standard cold-start problem of learned retrieval (REALM pretrains its retriever for this reason), so more steps would not have fixed it.

**So every step-1 latent result depends on per-hop retrieval labels.** In the toy they are free, because every question is generated from a known chain. They are also free for any training data generated from the knowledge base itself, as in KBLaM and LMLM. Still open: whether the labels are needed only to get retrieval started, and whether retrieval learned on templated questions carries over to other phrasing.

## What this does and doesn't show

**Shown, in this toy.** Given per-hop retrieval labels during training, a reasoner that retrieves inside its forward pass chains 3 lookups, writes out names it has never seen, and follows 1,000 edits through multi-hop reasoning at 100%, with no retraining. That matches the explicit-lookup ceiling. It also holds no world knowledge of its own. A dense model on the same data cannot compose facts it has memorized (the two-hop curse), and fine-tuning in edits leaves them unpropagated and damages everything else.

**Not shown yet:**

1. **Training without hop labels.** Without them retrieval never starts (see above). Open: are the labels needed throughout training, or only to get retrieval started?
2. **Toy difficulty.** Relations use fixed templates, names match store keys exactly, the store is always correct and complete, and no question needs more hops than there are read layers.
3. **Baselines.** The in-context oracle is broken. It gets 8–15% on 1-hop and does *better* on 3-hop; it trains on only 2% of its tokens. The dense arm gets no hop supervision. The only edit baseline for dense is naive fine-tuning, not MEMIT or AlphaEdit.
4. **Deletion.** Not measured yet. The leakage results suggest that deleting an entry leaves nothing behind, but that needs its own test.
5. **Parameter count.** The latent arm has 14% more parameters than the baselines.

## Next

1. `latent-multi` with hop supervision for the first 2,000 steps only (`--hop-until 2000`).
2. Harder toy: paraphrased and unseen relation phrasings, noisy name mentions, missing facts (abstain), 4-hop questions with 3 read layers.
3. Fix the context oracle.
4. A deletion test, plus a MEMIT/AlphaEdit baseline (EasyEdit, on a rented GPU).
5. Step 2: the latent read interface attached to a frozen Qwen3 / OLMo model.
